This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing Vanadium.

# System requirements

The instructions below assume you are using the [Bash][why-bash] shell.
<!-- @checkForBash @test -->
```
set | grep BASH > /dev/null || echo "Vanadium installation requires Bash."
```

In addition, they assume the following software packages are installed and
available in your `PATH`:

- curl
- [Go][go-install] 1.5 or above
- [Git] 2.4 or above

On OS X, you'll also need:

- [Homebrew][brew] package manager
- Full and up-to-date [Xcode]

## OS-specific setup details

For OS-specific setup details, consult these instructions:

- [Linux]
- [OS X][os-x]
- [Raspberry Pi][rpi]

# JIRI_ROOT environment variable

The Vanadium code is spread out across multiple git repositories. Though it's
possible to fetch the Vanadium Go code using standard `go get` commands, the
recommended approach is to use the `jiri` tool, which helps manage multiple
repositories.

Soon, we'll run a `bootstrap.sh` script that uses `jiri` to fetch the Vanadium
repositories. As such, we must first set the `JIRI_ROOT` environment variable.
Use an absolute path to a non-existent directory on the local filesystem. The
`bootstrap.sh` script will create this directory. (Remote filesystems such as
NFS are discouraged for performance reasons and to avoid git ENOKEY errors.)
<!-- @define_JIRI_ROOT @test -->
```
# Uses existing $JIRI_ROOT environment variable, defaults to ${HOME}/vanadium if
# $JIRI_ROOT is not set.
export JIRI_ROOT=${JIRI_ROOT:=${HOME}/vanadium}
```

Recommended for contributors: Add the line above to your `~/.bashrc` or similar.

# VANADIUM_RELEASE environment variable

The tutorials on this website use Go code from a particular subdirectory of
`JIRI_ROOT`. Tutorial users should set the `VANADIUM_RELEASE` environment variable to
this directory, as follows:
<!-- @define_VANADIUM_RELEASE @test -->
```
# Needed for tutorials only.
export VANADIUM_RELEASE=${JIRI_ROOT}/release/go
```

# Prompt for a clean slate

The `bootstrap.sh` script checks that the `JIRI_ROOT` directory does not yet
exist, then creates it. If it exists, warn the user with a clear message about
trying to install over an existing path and provide instructions on how to
correct.

<!-- @check_JIRI_ROOT @test -->
```
# Check that the JIRI_ROOT path does not exist.
if [[ -e "${JIRI_ROOT}" ]]; then
  echo ""
  echo "ERROR: The JIRI_ROOT path already exists: ${JIRI_ROOT}"
  echo "To proceed with a fresh install remove the directory and re-run:"
  echo ""
  echo "    rm -rf ${JIRI_ROOT}"
  echo ""
  echo "Or set JIRI_ROOT to a different path."
  exit 1
fi
```

# Fetch Vanadium repositories

Run the `bootstrap.sh` script. This script will (1) install the `jiri` tool in
your `JIRI_ROOT` directory, (2) `git clone` a Vanadium-specific manifest
repository that configures `jiri` for the Vanadium project, and (3) use the
`jiri` tool to fetch all of the Vanadium repositories. Notably, this script will
not write to any files outside of the `JIRI_ROOT` directory.
<!-- @runBootstrapScript @test -->
```
# This can take several minutes.
curl -f https://vanadium.github.io/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Add `$JIRI_ROOT/.jiri_root/scripts` to your `PATH`, for `jiri`:
<!-- @addDevtoolsToPath @test -->
```
export PATH=$JIRI_ROOT/.jiri_root/scripts:$PATH
```

Recommended for contributors: Add the line above to your `~/.bashrc` or similar.

# Additional prerequisites

Some components of Vanadium (e.g. Syncbase) have additional prerequisites,
including Snappy and LevelDB.

We recommend using the `jiri profile` command to install the v23:base profile,
which includes all such prerequisites.

First, install any os packages that the v23:base profile needs.  The following
line will inspect your currently installed packages, and if any additional
packages need to be installed, it will print a command that will install them.
Note that the printed command may need to be run as root.

<!-- @packagesBaseProfile @test -->
```
# Print the package installation command.
jiri profile os-packages v23:base

# Run the package installation command as root.
if [ -n "$(jiri profile os-packages v23:base)" ]; then
  sudo $(jiri profile os-packages v23:base)
fi
```

Then install the prerequisites themselves.
<!-- @installBaseProfile @test -->
```
jiri profile install v23:base
```

The `jiri profile install` command only writes to files under `JIRI_ROOT`,
i.e. it will not write to system folders such as those under `/usr`.

# Install Vanadium binaries

For simplicity, we use `jiri go` to install tools. The `jiri go` command simply
augments the `GOPATH` environment variable with the various paths to Vanadium Go
code under the `JIRI_ROOT` directory, and then runs the standard `go` tool.
<!-- @installVanadiumBinaries @test -->
```
# Install specific tools needed for the tutorials.
jiri go install v.io/x/ref/cmd/... v.io/x/ref/services/agent/... v.io/x/ref/services/mounttable/... v.io/x/ref/services/syncbase/...
```

# Verifying installation

Compile all Go code:

    jiri go build v.io/...

Run all Go tests:

    jiri go test v.io/...

<!-- TODO: On OS X, this opens a bunch of warning popups about accepting
incoming connections. We should make all test servers listen on the loopback
address. -->

Install all Go binaries:

    jiri go install v.io/...

You should now have the following binaries available, among others:

- `$JIRI_ROOT/release/go/bin/mounttabled`
- `$JIRI_ROOT/release/go/bin/syncbased`
- `$JIRI_ROOT/release/go/bin/vrpc`
