Vanadium Core is an [open-source](https://github.com/vanadium/core) framework
designed to make it much easier to develop secure, distributed applications
that can run anywhere. It provides:

      **Complete security model**<br>
      Vanadium's security model is based on public-key cryptography, that supports
      fine-grained permissions and delegation. The combination of traditional ACLs
      and "blessings with caveats" supports a broad set of practical requirements.

      **Symmetrically authenticated and encrypted RPC**<br>
      Vanadium Core provides symmetrically authenticated and encrypted RPC, with
      support for bi-directional
      messaging, streaming and proxying, that works on a variety of network
      protocols, including TCP and Bluetooth. The result is a secure communications
      infrastructure that can be used for large-scale datacenter applications as
      well as for smaller-scale enterprise and consumer applications, including
      those needing to cross NAT boundaries.
      All data on the wire is encoded using Vanadium Object Marshalling (VOM),
      which is a performant, self-describing encoding format.

      **Distributed naming and discovery**<br>
      Vanadium provides a global naming service that offers the convenience of
      urls but allows for federation and multi-level resolution. The
      'programming model' consists of nothing more than invoking methods on
      names, subject to security checks. Vanadium also provides a discovery API
      for advertising and scanning for services over a variety of protocols,
      including BLE and mDNS (Bonjour).
