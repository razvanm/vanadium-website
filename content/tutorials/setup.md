You don't need to read this, unless you were sent here with a suggestion to
start a second tutorial terminal, likely to keep the output from multiple
processes easier to read.

In addition to the `$VANADIUM_RELEASE` variable defined by [installation], every
terminal window used in a tutorial must run the environment definition script
below.

If you follow the prerequisite instructions at the beginning of a tutorial,
you'll implicitly run the script on this page, and you'll run commands from
earlier tutorials that create the _files_ needed by your current tutorial.

A second terminal won't need to recreate the files, but will need the [bash]
environment defined below.

<!-- @envVars @buildjs @test @testui @completer -->
```
# If JIRI_ROOT or VANADIUM_RELEASE are not defined, set them to the default values
# from the installation instructions and hope for the best.

[ -z "${JIRI_ROOT}" ] && export JIRI_ROOT=${HOME}/vanadium
[ -z "${VANADIUM_RELEASE}" ] && export VANADIUM_RELEASE=${JIRI_ROOT}/release/go

# All files created by the tutorial will be placed in $V_TUT. It is a disposable
# workspace, easy to recreate.
export V_TUT=${V_TUT-$HOME/v23_tutorial}

# V_BIN is the location for Vanadium binaries.
export V_BIN=${VANADIUM_RELEASE}/bin

# Include the Vanadium binaries in the PATH.
export PATH=${V_BIN}:${PATH}

# For the shell doing the tutorials, GOPATH must include both Vanadium and the
# code created as a result of doing the tutorials. To avoid trouble with
# accumulation, $GOPATH is intentionally omitted from the right hand side (any
# existing value is ignored).
if [ -z "${V23_GOPATH}" ]; then
  export V23_GOPATH=`${JIRI_ROOT}/.jiri_root/scripts/jiri go env GOPATH`
fi
export GOPATH=${V_TUT}:${V23_GOPATH}

# HISTCONTROL set as follows excludes long file creation commands used in
# tutorials from your shell history.
HISTCONTROL=ignorespace

# A convenience for killing tutorial processes
function kill_tut_process() {
  eval local pid=\$$1
  if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
    kill $pid || true
    wait $pid || true
    eval unset $1
  fi
}
```
