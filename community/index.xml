      <description>Syncbase API usability  We have recently conducted API usability tests and are working on a new high-level API to help developers get started quickly with Syncbase.
 Website, docs &amp;amp; sample app improvements   My First App: Android &amp;amp; iOS todo tutorial (and sample app with new APIs) update syncslides to new API tutorial that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require syncbase cloud   Blobs  Blobs are already implemented in Go and sync across Syncbase instances, and there exists low-level RPC support, also in Go; however, there is not yet a high level API in Swift or Java to access this functionality on an iOS or Android device.</description>
